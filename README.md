## Overview

Our goal is to use housing data for King County, Washington in order to analyze and predict the price of a house for based on criterias such as list price, sell price, square footage, amount of land, how many bedrooms and or bathrooms.  We want to see what factors effect the pricing of housing.  The data we are using was pulled from Kaggle, but we hope to be able find more data along the way to be able to merge.  We plan to use a Multilinear Regression ML to calculate our answers.  We hope to be able to create a website where a user can input information about their house to give what price their home should be worth.
